# FixBlox Product Direction

## Core Identity
FixBlox is EnquiryOps for trades.

Our primary job is to ensure every enquiry is:
- Responded to
- Qualified
- Booked or clearly closed

We are not:
- A job tracking system
- A generic CRM
- An MSP or IT support provider

## Core Offering (Now)
### EnquiryOps (Managed Services)
- Inbox and enquiry handling
- Booking coordination
- Quote sending and chasing
- Follow-up administration
- Missed enquiry recovery

This is the primary revenue driver.

## Entry Points
- Simple websites
- QuoteFlow
- AI receptionist

These exist to feed EnquiryOps.

## Internal-Only Tools (Not Customer Products)
### LeadScore
Used internally to:
- Prioritise enquiries
- Identify high-value jobs
- Reduce wasted admin time

Not sold as a standalone product.

## Explicitly Not Building
- Full job tracking systems
- Scheduling with GPS routing
- Financial margin tracking
- Generic CRM features

If requested, these should be integrated with existing tools, not rebuilt.

## Build Rule
Only build features that:
- Increase booked jobs
- Reduce admin load
- Support managed services

If a feature does not support EnquiryOps, it does not get built.
